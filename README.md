# AWS-distributed-Computing


## Introduction:
Nowadays, data has become the new gold of this century, where in response to escalating file processing demands, the imperative transition to cloud-based solutions is evident. Leveraging the inherent scalability and agility of cloud infrastructure, particularly Amazon Web Services (AWS), facilitates the seamless orchestration of distributed computing paradigms. This article elucidates the design and implementation of a sophisticated cloud architecture, spotlighting the pivotal role of worker Lambdas, S3 buckets, and distributed computing principles.
On this article we are going to focus on use AWS to process a huge amount of data, making a scalable architecture, scalable and asynchronous. 

The corresponding files to process are as follow: 
- Type A: These files will contain mathematical equations containing whole numbers and minus, plus and division operators. 
- Type B: These files will contain words and you will have to reverse them. 
- Type C: These files will contain binary, and you will convert them to ASCI
